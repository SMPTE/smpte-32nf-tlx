Email from Bill Redmann on 2021-05-05 subject: Three-part harmony

On the last call, the chair was tasked with proposing an organization of Parts 1, 2, and 3, including how they relate among themselves.  In particular, what are the normative dependencies between the parts?

Here’s my take...

---
For all three parts:
  Each needs to include a scope that , when collected into the Part 0 document (which HQ compiles), provides a sensible description of the suite.  Those three descriptions should provide a capsule summary of the TLX.
---

Part 1 is independent of the other parts and should:

1.1) provide definitions for
                media unit
                sequence
                source
                TLX label
                (identifiers, timestamps, counts, etc. are all related to items that are not discussed until part 2)
                -> I propose you start with the definitions found here:
                Files > Working Documents > older Working Documents > [20200522 Requirement List v12.docx](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/790E1504-009C-492B-85DA-972345FEEF83?tenantId=c6051a58-269b-4f08-835f-eedebf4596b3&fileType=docx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsmpte.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2F32nf80-tlx%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FWorking%20Documents%2Folder%20Working%20Documents%2F20200529%20Requirement%20List%20v13.docx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsmpte.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2F32nf80-tlx&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:5d34748acf9e43f8a530bcacbdbfcf85@thread.tacv2&groupId=b1606f7d-99ec-4545-9182-a65522d2066f)
				
                The definitions start on the second page.  Most (all?) of them are already in ISO format.  We can amend as needed, but at least that document has definitions we agreed a year ago were fine to leave alone until we knew more.  Maybe now we do know more!

1.2) describe the relationships between
                sources and media units
                media units and sequences
                  how editing of sequence(s) produces a new seuquence
                TLX labels and media units (indicate that embedding or otherwise explicit associations between TLX labels and media units is outside the scope of Parts 1-3)

1.3) describe the structure of a TLX
                (an unordered collection of uniquely named items)
                > this implies that multiples of an itemKind
                  will have to inside an itemkind collection,
                                which is itself a kind of item

                (clarify if the TLX can be empty - should it be allowed?)

                exemplar JSON schema (bogus item type)

1.4) describe the structure of an item
                (an unordered set of uniquely named attributes

1.5)  Provide an authoritative JSON schema for TLX in the prose - the schema file should (debatably) be associated with Part 2)

1.6) Provide an example schema for an item (e.g., based on a “foo & bar” version of one of John’s item tables).

1.7) Provide an informative example JSON file of a TLX with one or two (different kinds of) items as suggested by the schemas from 5 & 6.

1.8) consider if there’s anything to be said about other carriage formats (MXF, etc.) My guess is that’s a different part (part 4?) which is crafted primarily to supply the strategy and UL details (much as ST 2094-2 is to the rest of the ST 2094 suite - parts 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40).

1.9) [what am I missing?]

-----

Part 2 should normatively reference Part 1 and should:

2.1) describe each item and its attributes,

2.2) provide the normative description of each attribute

2.3) provide general observations (normative and/or informative) regarding each individual attribute.  However, normative assertions regard specific combinations of items should (debatably) be left to part 3, where there can be normative language as to the conditions of this or that being present/absent.

2.4)  provide a JSON schema file (non-prose element following the rules from Part 1) that includes TLX and all the items in Part 2.

---

Consider for our own review, we should produce a few sample TLX JSON example(s) that could be used to insanity-check the schema.

---

Part 3 will normatively reference parts 1 and 2 for its work.  There are a number of comments in part 2 which suggest that thoughts be migrated to Part 3. 

3..1) definitions for:
                Profile
                Requirement
                compliance

3.2) provide a discussion of profiles - what they’re for, what they promise

3.3) provide a profile for DBC (start here as our “best understood” model of what it is and what it can do)  (this might later become lighter-weight profiles, i.e., two-legged stools, that work in certain prescribed circumstances.

3.2) provide a profile ST12 workflows, which requires TLXst12 and supports TLXsourceName (are these two profiles? One that only requires TLXst12 and one that requires both?)
